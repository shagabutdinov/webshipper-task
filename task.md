Webshipper Test Task
====================

In this task you must build upon a framework provided by Webshipper. Feel free
to make anything changes youâ€™d like to this repository.

https://exchangeratesapi.io/ provides an api for fetching currency exchange
rates. Use this api to build a small web service that converts a given amount
from one currency to another. The web service should be exposed as a REST API.
You are free to choose whatever strategy you see fit to solve this task.
However, the solution must be tested using some form of automated tests and
follow best practice for modern web development. Furthermore, it should be
documented well enough that other developers can use it and continue developing
it. We expect your solution to be good enough to be used in a real production
environment.

Extra Credit: Make a small frontend for the API in your favourite javascript
framework.

When you are done please send the project as a zip file to jobs@webshipper.io
along with your contact information (name, phone, email, skype)
